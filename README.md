Hangman Game in Python

This Python program implements the classic Hangman game. It randomly selects a word from a predefined list and allows the player to guess the letters in the word. The player has limited chances to guess the correct letters before the hangman is fully drawn. The game provides visual feedback on the progress and outcome of each guess. The game loop continues until the player correctly guesses the word or exhausts all the chances.

Features:

Random word selection from a predefined list.
Visual representation of the hangman figure as incorrect guesses accumulate.
Prevents repeated guesses of the same letter.
Informs the player about their win or loss.

Feel free to play and enjoy this simple and fun Hangman game!
